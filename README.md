## Setup

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iceglober/aflow/main/install.sh | bash
af skills    # install slash commands in your repo
```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Node.js 20+ and the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com).

<br/>

## The Full Loop

> From blank page to merged PR — 7 commands.

```bash
# ── design ──────────────────────────────────────────
/research-web  Build a multi-tenant billing system with usage-based pricing
/spec-make     research/billing focused on metering and invoicing
/spec-enrich   research/billing/spec-metering.md
/spec-refine   research/billing/spec-metering-v2.md

# ── build ───────────────────────────────────────────
/work  Add usage metering API per spec R-01 through R-05
/qa
/ship
```

<br/>

## Commands

### `design` — idea to spec

> Each step reduces ambiguity. Loop `enrich → refine` until unknowns hit zero.

```
/research-web  →  /spec-make  →  /spec-enrich  →  /spec-refine × N  →  /spec-review
                                                                           ↕
                                                                       /spec-lab
```

| Command | What happens |
|:--|:--|
| `/research-web` | Spawns parallel research agents, synthesizes findings |
| `/spec-make` | Turns research _or a plain description_ into a spec with tracked unknowns |
| `/spec-enrich` | Reads your codebase to resolve unknowns autonomously |
| `/spec-refine` | Walks through remaining unknowns with you, one at a time |
| `/spec-review` | Audits the spec for gaps, conflicts, and opportunities |
| `/spec-lab` | Runs yes/no validation experiments against unknowns |

<details>
<summary><code>/spec-make</code> works from research or a description</summary>

```bash
/spec-make research/billing focused on metering
/spec-make A CSV export feature with configurable column selection
```
</details>

<br/>

### `build` — spec to production

| Command | What happens |
|:--|:--|
| `/think` | Strategy session — forces "why" before "how" |
| `/work` | Implements from a description. Pulls latest, creates branch, codes. |
| `/work-backlog` | Works through `.aflow/backlog.json` checklist items |
| `/fix` | Targeted bug fixes within task scope |
| `/qa` | Diffs against acceptance criteria. PASS/FAIL per scenario. |
| `/ship` | Typecheck → review → commit → push → PR |

<br/>

## Skills

> Skills activate automatically when relevant — no slash command needed.

| Skill | When it activates |
|:--|:--|
| `/browser` | UI testing in `/qa`, PR screenshots in `/ship`. Powered by [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp). |
| `/research-auto` | Autonomous think→test→reflect experimentation loop. Based on [ResearcherSkill](https://github.com/krzysztofdudek/ResearcherSkill). |

```bash
/research-auto  Optimize p99 latency of /api/billing/usage endpoint
```

<br/>

## Worktrees

```bash
af wt create feature-auth        # new branch + worktree
af wt checkout feature-payments   # from existing remote branch
af wt list                        # show all
af wt cleanup                     # delete merged/stale
```
